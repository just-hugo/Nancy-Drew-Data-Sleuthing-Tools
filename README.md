A few months into my first software job, I asked my manager what I could do in my spare time to learn and improve. She suggested that I find a public API and learn to work with it.

I chose the CDC Wonder API, though I also dabbled in using the FBI Crime Data Explorer. I learned a lot by sifting through their documentation and by trial and error. I had a lot of fun on this project. It is by no means complete, but this code is capable of querying either database and parsing the response into either a CSV or a JSON.
